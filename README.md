# Useful Commands

This mod only needs to be installed on the server.

## Features
More datapack tags (e.g. #extra:zombies)

`/sb_operation` (extra scoreboard arithmetic commands)

`/velocity` (modify and get motion, even works with players)

`/damage` (deal damage to an entity)


Q: Why even use this mod? What's the point of using datapacks if you're already using mods

A: Well I'm glad you asked. Mods like these are useful when the server datapack needs certain features that are not available in the base game and the client is completely vanilla. This avoids the hassle of getting your players to install mods, of which they might have difficulty doing so.
